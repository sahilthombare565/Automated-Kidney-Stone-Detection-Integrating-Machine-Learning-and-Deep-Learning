Data Collection:Gathered a comprehensive dataset of CT scan images featuring kidney stones, encompassing both normal and abnormal cases with varied sizes and types.

Preprocessing: Developed robust preprocessing techniques to optimize image quality, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation for enhanced model generalization.

Feature Extraction:Implemented advanced feature extraction methods utilizing the Xception model for image extraction and custom CNN architectures tailored to kidney stone attributes.

Model Development:Created machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., custom CNN architectures) for automated kidney stone detection and segmentation.
Designed and trained models specifically for classification and segmentation tasks, incorporating fine-tuning as necessary.

Evaluation and Metrics:Evaluated model performance metrics including accuracy, precision to quantify the effectiveness of kidney stone detection. (Note: recall, and F1-score were not calculated in this project.)

Integration and Deployment:Prepared the project for seamless integration into a GitHub repository, focusing on comprehensive documentation, well-organized code structure, and considerations for future deployment scenarios.

Additional Features:Implemented a Treatment Recommendation system based on detected kidney stone attributes.
Utilized Streamlit as the backend for interactive visualization and user interface.
